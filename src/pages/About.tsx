      <section className="mission-section">
        <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Raising unstoppable generations. Empowering Saints. Fulfilling Destiny.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="vision-section">
        <h2>VISION STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          We are a God-sensitive and seeker-friendly church, creating an atmosphere where people's needs are met, minds are empowered, and spirits are fed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are one big family of believers, bound together by our fervent love for God.

      <section className="core-values-section">
        <h2>OUR CORE VALUES</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Knowledge is the reason for decision. A man's ignorance explains his crisis. When you know better, you will do better. The primary avenue for acquiring knowledge is study.</li>
          <li><strong>Love:</strong> Love is the foundation of our faith, driving us to serve and care for one another unconditionally.</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> We hold ourselves accountable to God and one another, walking in integrity and transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>Excellence:</strong> We pursue excellence in all things, honoring God with our best efforts and stewardship of resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Worship:</strong> Worship is placing appropriate value on someone whose presence you cannot do without and whose absence you cannot afford. It is recognizing God as the irreplaceable constant.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance:</strong> We strive for balance in our spiritual, personal, and professional lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Service:</strong> Servicing God is a privilege. It is an opportunity to honor God and live a life of relevance. Service must be rendered to God with understanding and sincerity of heart.</li>
          <li><strong>Training:</strong> Training is a way of making investments in the becoming possibilities of another. It is both instructional and practical. If you must reign, you must be trained—training is required for exploits. A good athlete is a product of an excellent coach.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="gospel-section">
        <h2>WE PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
        <p>Heaven is the home of the saved, not the religious or moral. If we don't preach the gospel, men will not be saved.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="add-value-section">
        <h2>ADD VALUE</h2>
        <p>We seek to add value to the lives of others, both inside and outside our church community.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="beliefs-section">
  <h2>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scripture:</strong> The Bible is the inspired Word of God, our ultimate authority for faith and practice.</li>
    <li><strong>Salvation:</strong> We believe in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone, by grace and not by works.</li>
    <li><strong>Holy Spirit:</strong> The Holy Spirit empowers believers for life, service, and spiritual growth.</li>
    <li><strong>The Church:</strong> The Church is the body of Christ, called to advance God’s Kingdom on earth.</li>
  </ul>
